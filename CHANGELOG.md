# Changelog
## :banana: v0.4.1
- ### :detective: Bug-Fixes
    - Issue [8](https://github.com/RusPiRo/ruspiro-allocator/issues/8) : If previously freed memory was re-used for a new allocation that did not fit into a fixed memory bucket could lead to memory curruption on the heap if the re-uses size was larger than the original size of the re-used block.
- ### :wrench: Maintenance
    - Switch to `cargo-make` and `Makefile.toml` to run the reliable build process, locally and in CI.

## :pizza: v0.4.0
- ### :bulb: Features
    - Removed the whole ``C`` implementation and implement the allocator completely in ``Rust``.
    - Memory allocation is now completely lock free and uses atomic primitives to ensure cross core
    concurrent correctness when allocating and releasing memory

## :carrot: v0.3.1 Release Notes
- ### ðŸ”§ Maintenance
    - Remove usage of memset assembly
    - Remove use of custom oom handler trick as the #[alloc_error_handler] seem now implemented in Rust correctly.
